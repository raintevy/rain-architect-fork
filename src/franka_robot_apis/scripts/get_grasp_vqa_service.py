"""Verify a grasp using a vision-language model.

ROS1 Noetic service node. Per request it reads the current gripper width via
/robot/proprioception/get_gripper_width, captures the latest cached wrist-camera
image, runs a cheap proprioception gate to reject obvious empties, and (if
plausible) sends the image plus a discriminative prompt to Azure OpenAI (or
OpenAI / local Qwen) and parses an Answer: yes|no response.

        f"between them and no part of the {object_name} bridging that "
        f"space.\n"
